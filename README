***********************************************************

To play Shipz, you will have to connect to a Shipz-server.
Currently this server cannot be run on the same machine as
the client. If you are lucky, the server running on a 
machine at Steve's is online, so you can join the heat.

If this is not the case, one could start it's own server
in the following way:
	
	$ shipz server <levelinfo-file>
	NOTE: only the name of the levelinfo-file is needed,
	there is no need to supply the path.

To start the client, type:
	
	$ shipz client <server> <nickname>

This will start Shipz in windowed mode, and with sound
disabled. If you have compiled with the frontend however,
you may just issue:

	$ shipz

Which will popup a frontend to Shipz, allowing you to
choose between server and client mode, and also enabling
you the choice between windowed/fullscreen mode and sound.

Have fun playing Shipz.

	Greetz,
	The KillaFish team.
