# Shipz v2 Resurrection 

Hi there! This is an effort to ressurect an old project that I and an old
school buddy worked on. It is currently in rough shape as I am rewriting it
to work with SDL3 and get the code in a little bit better shape than I left it.

If you want to try to build it, there is a stable branch that I suggest you
check out.
